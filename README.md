# EpriLoadShapeContructor

This repo contains a jupyter notebook script to transform data from the [Electric Power Research Institute](https://loadshape.epri.com/wholepremise).


The data is a whole premise loadshape data that gives hourwise loads for a variety of buildings including churches, movie theaters, hospitals, educational facilities, hotels, and more. 

The data can be loaded, filtered by location, filtered by building, and summed for each hour to esimate the total load in kW for a particular location.
